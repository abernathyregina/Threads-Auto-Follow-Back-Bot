## Introduction
The **Threads Auto Follow Back Bot** automatically identifies new followers and reciprocates the action using real Android devices or emulators. It eliminates the manual process of checking notifications and following back each user individually.

### Automating Threads Follower Reciprocity
- Detects new followers in real-time and instantly follows them back.
- Works across multiple Threads accounts simultaneously.
- Maintains human-like delay and gesture randomness for undetectable automation.
- Reduces manual workload and boosts social engagement metrics.
- Optimized for large-scale operations and mobile device farms.

## Core Features

- **Real Devices and Emulators:** Works seamlessly across physical Android devices or emulators to simulate genuine app usage.
- **No-ADB Wireless Automation:** Executes all actions wirelessly without requiring ADB connection or rooting.
- **Mimicking Human Behavior:** Incorporates smart delays, gesture randomization, and scrolling patterns.
- **Multiple Accounts Support:** Manages several Threads accounts concurrently, maintaining separate sessions and cookies.
- **Multi-Device Integration:** Integrates with hundreds of devices through the Appilot device manager.
- **Exponential Growth for Your Account:** Helps maintain follower reciprocity, increasing engagement and visibility.
- **Premium Support:** Priority technical support with setup assistance and device scaling.

## How It Works
1. **Input or Trigger:** The automation is activated through the Appilot dashboard, where the user connects Threads accounts and sets follow-back conditions.
2. **Core Logic:** Appilot monitors Threads notifications using UI Automator or Accessibility services to detect new followers.
3. **Action Execution:** The bot navigates to the followerâ€™s profile and performs a natural follow action.
4. **Output or Action:** Results are logged into the dashboard, updating follow-back ratios and account performance.
5. **Other Functionalities:** Retry mechanisms, proxy rotation, and detailed logging ensure smooth operation and traceability.

## Tech Stack
**Language:** Kotlin, Python, JavaScript  
**Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, Espresso, Robot Framework  
**Tools:** Appilot, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Appium Inspector, Bluestacks, Nox Player, Scrcpy, Firebase Test Lab  
**Infrastructure:** Dockerized device farms, Cloud-based emulators, Proxy networks, Parallel Device Execution, Real device clusters

## FAQs
**How do I configure it for multiple accounts?**  
Add credentials in the `credentials.env` file and Appilot will auto-assign proxies and sessions for each account.

**Does it support proxy rotation?**  
Yes, rotating mobile and residential proxies can be integrated for each device instance.

**Can I limit the number of follow-backs per day?**  
Absolutely, use the task scheduler in `settings.yaml` to set daily or hourly limits.

**Is this detectable by Threads?**  
No, the automation mimics real user behavior through randomized interaction and timing.

**Can I view statistics or reports?**  
Yes, all actions and results are available in the analytics dashboard and logged into `metrics.csv`.
